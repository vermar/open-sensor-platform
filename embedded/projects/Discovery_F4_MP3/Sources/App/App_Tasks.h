/**
** ASF_TASK_STATIC ( ThreadId, EntryFunction, Priority, StackSize, QueueSize )
**      This macro declares a static thread that will be created (along with an
**      associated queue) automatically by the ASF startup initialization and
**      will persist throughout the lifetime of the application.
**
** Parameters:
**      ThreadId - User defined C-Style identifier for the thread.
**                 E.g. MY_THREAD_ID. This identifier will be used in the
**                 application to access the thread properties and its
**                 associated queue.
**      EntryFunction - Thread entry function name.
**      Priority - Thread priority in the range of 51 through 254. Higher value
**                 implies higher priority. Values 0 through 50 are reserved and
**                 should not be used.
**      StackSize - Thread stack size in bytes.
**      QueueSize - This denotes the maximum number of messages that are allowed
**                 to be queued for the thread. An optimum value should be
**                 chosen for this parameter to minimize memory wastage.
**
**      Example:   ASF_TASK_STATIC ( COMM_THREAD, CommThreadEntry, 55, 1024, 10 )
**
** Entry Function must be declared in the following manner:
**      ASF_TASK MyThreadEntry ( ASF_TASK_ARG )
**      {
**          ...
**      }
**
