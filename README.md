## Whats New In This Branch

This branch implements CMSIS-RTX adaptation of ASF and corresponding changes in the Discovery_F4 MP3 application.

It is a first step towards using open source/ free toolchain (CMSIS-RTX is compatible with GCC). Work in progress on getting the project to compile on Atollic TrueSTUDIO Lite (free!) IDE.
