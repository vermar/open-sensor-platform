OSP Hello World
===============
## Update: 01-Oct-2016

GCC Support is here! Happy to announce that I was successfully able to adapt the Discovery_F4 MP3 project to Atollic TrueSTUDIO ARM v6.0.0 Lite version.
Based on what Google is showing with some preliminary searching, this maybe the first project that provides a reference for CMSIS-RTX with GCC working on an STM32 device.

## Whats New In This Branch

This branch implements CMSIS-RTX adaptation of ASF and corresponding changes in the Discovery_F4 MP3 application.

It is a first step towards using open source/ free toolchain (CMSIS-RTX is compatible with GCC). Work in progress on getting the project to compile on Atollic TrueSTUDIO Lite (free!) IDE.
